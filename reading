POINTS TO REMEMBER
> By default, all state names are converted to use ui-router's dot notation (e.g. parentStateName.childStateName) in app.js file where we declare our states.

> This can be disabled by calling .state() with options options.keepOriginalNames = true.

when this option is not specified, when we try to go tot state "home" by clicking the link
<a ui-sref="home">Home</a> it will check for ".home" transition to state "root.home" in app.js,
but we din't specify .home inside of our ui-sref attribute so it throuws an error.

So inorder to avoid that prefixed "dot notation" we use this keepOriginalNames as "true"
so it directly checks fro state 'home' within state 'root'

To see the effect set that value to be "false" and prefix a 'dot' before 'home' in ui-sref
attribute it will work.
